### Bio
I'm João Victor, a programmer with a Computer Science degree from [Universidade Federal de São Carlos](https://www.ufscar.br/). Currently working as a Software Engineer at Google.

During my professional career I've dabbled in a variety of languages and technologies. Most of my recent work has been in the Android OS and server side development. I also worked on front-end and metrics (collection and impl of complex queries for dashboards).

The languages I'm more comfortable with, roughly in order, are: Kotlin, Java, C/C++, Rust, TS/JS, Python.
