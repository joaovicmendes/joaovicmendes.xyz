### Bio
I'm a Software Engineer at Google, with a degree in Computer Science from [Universidade Federal de São Carlos, UFSCar](https://www.ufscar.br/). Eager to learn about new technologies, leadership and to expand knowledge of performance optimization, reliability, and software engineering.

My professional work has been mostly on the Android operating system (Java), back-end development (C++, Java, TypeScript) and more recently mobile (Android, Kotlin). I have *touched* front-end code (React, Redux and JavaScript) and did some (*this is being generous*) data analysis (Python, Google Colab).

Currently: diving into the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) ecosystem.
