### Bio
I'm João Victor, a Brazilian programmer with a Computer Science degree from [Universidade Federal de São Carlos, UFSCar](https://www.ufscar.br/). I currently work as a Software Engineer at Google.

During my professional career I've dabbled in a variety of languages and technologies. Most of my work has been in the Android operating system (using Java and Kotlin) and back-end development (Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, C++).

I have *touched* front-end code (JS, React) and worked a bit with data analysis (Python, Colab). I've also created some metrics dashboards (SQL, some custom Google frameworks).
