### Bio
I'm João Victor, a programmer with a Computer Science degree from [Universidade Federal de São Carlos](https://www.ufscar.br/). Currently working as a Software Engineer at Google.

During my professional career I've dabbled in a variety of languages and technologies. Most of my recent work has been in the Android OS and some server side development. Every once in a while I *touch* front-end code, work a bit with data analysis, and create some metric queries and dashboards.

The languages I'm more comfortable with, roughly in order, are: C, C++, Java, Rust, TS, JS, Kotlin, Python.
